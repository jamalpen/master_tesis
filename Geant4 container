# Geant4 container

First, create a working directory on your local computer:

```
cd
mkdir Geant4_Simulations
chmod -R 777 Geant4_Simulations
```

Then, download the Geant4 container and start it with the docker run command.

If you are on native Linux and want to use X11-forwarding, use

```bash
docker run -it --env="LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1"  --name my_geant4   --net=host   --env="DISPLAY"   -v $HOME/.Xauthority:/root/.Xauthority:rw   -v ${HOME}/Geant4_Simulations:/home/geant4lab/Geant4_projects   jpenafiell/geant4-v10.3.0:latest
```

Now let's understand the options that were used for the docker run command

* First, the `-it` option means to start the container in interactive mode. Essentially, you'll find yourself within the environment of the container.
